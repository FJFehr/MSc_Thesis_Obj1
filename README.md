# Masters Thesis Objective 1

This repository will cover the first objective for my Masters thesis titled "Modeling linear and non-linear shape spaces" 

The first objective:

Develop a exploratory data analysis framework to identify non-linearity in 3D mesh data through the use of autoencoders (AE).

- Use PCA to develope a Point Distribution Model and consider modes of variation, scattergrams and number of principal components required to explain the variation
- Draw an approximate equivalence between Linear AE and PCA.
- Compare Linear AE with Non-linear AE

This will show the importance of considering non-linearities withing 3D mesh data.
